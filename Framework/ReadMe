This is testcases for Robot framework using selenium module:




Here i have defined different folders which contains code blocks, 

In every directory i have defined the path to the recurring directory to run the testcase.

I have done 2 testcases for Login page and 2 testcases for registration page with different websites.

All the website which i have used here are Open-Source.

Also defined "Jenkins" and "Docker" files to deploy and run the code.
